# StoredProcedureTester
Objective: Create a simple program that will generate and run the SQL needed to compare two SP's, these stored procedures should produce the exact same results.
This was created to help prove performance improvements for Stored Procedures could be trusted, proving not only that changes between two SP's are faster but they also return the same results.
Although this is still a work in progress, it does show my coding style, competency.
